# geometrics_data_converter

> Convert Acquisition data from the Geometrics MFAM Development Kit to a single txt file

This is a python script that reads a zip file or a regular folder containing multiple files named 1.txt 2.txt 3.txt â€¦ (charset=binary) and one file named aquinfo.txt and merges the files starting with a number into one big txt file, on each separate file, the first 2 lines need to be removed, as well as any empty lines, in the end you should have a new folder named <folder_name> containing one txt file named <folder_name>_data.txt and one file aquinfo.txt. The output txt file is also in binary txt.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- zipfile module
- shutil module
- sys module
- glob module
- re module
- natsort module

## Usage

You can run the script from the command line with the following syntax:

`python3 converter.py <input path> <output path>`

The input path can be either a zip file or a regular folder. The output path must be a folder. If you do not provide any arguments, the script will use the default input path as ./data and the output path as ./output. It will also convert all zip files in ./data that start with ACQU.

## Example

Suppose you have a zip file named ACQU_2023_01.zip in the raw_data directory. It contains the following files:

- 1.txt
- 2.txt
- 3.txt
- aquinfo.txt

You want to merge the files 1.txt, 2.txt and 3.txt into one big txt file named ACQU_2023_01_data.txt. You can run the script as follows:

`python3 converter.py`

The script will merge the files and save it in the output folder as ACQU_2023_01_data.txt.

The ACQU_2023_01_data.txt file will be a binary txt file that contains the merged content of 1.txt, 2.txt and 3.txt without the first two lines and any empty lines.
